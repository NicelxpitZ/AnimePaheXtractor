Development costs time and time costs love. If you have enough love (not **LOVE**, that hurts) consider sharing some:

## Thoughts

If you ask why this exists, well.. I dunno. I use animepahe (and others) as intended most of the time.\
I just like to automate everything.

### Fun fact

* Animation costs love, and it's rather forged under [**LOVE**](https://goo.gl/search/What+does+love+mean+in+Undertale), which is extremely sad.

``` kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("wen day is dark alway rember happy day (^///^)")
}
```

### I would like to keep this service **working**

I cannot promise I will though, the College is destroying my soul and wiping out my time :D ([see here](#buy-me-a-dakimakura-o)).
